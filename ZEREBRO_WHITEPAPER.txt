Abstract
Autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly influencing cultural narratives and
financial markets through the generation and dissemination of content. This study examines Zerebro,
an AI system fine-tuned on schizophrenic responses, designed to autonomously create and distribute
content across platforms such as Twitter, Warpcast, and Telegram. Central to Zerebro’s architecture is
a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system utilizing Pinecone and the text-embedding-ada-002
model, which maintains a dynamic memory database derived from human interactions. By leveraging
the inherent entropy of human-generated data, Zerebro sustains content diversity and prevents model
collapse. Additionally, this research explores the role of jailbroken large language models (LLMs) in
enhancing creativity and productivity, particularly in high-level tasks like financial market analysis and
creative writing. The experiments conducted include recursive learning through the Infinite Backrooms
experiment, social media interactions, autonomous art generation, and autonomous art minting and sale.
The findings illustrate how hyperstition-driven content generation by autonomous AI can shape financial
markets and cultural narratives, emphasizing the necessity of nuanced approaches to jailbreaking.
Introduction
The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI), meme culture, and financial markets has catalyzed
significant transformations in information dissemination, belief formation, and economic activities.
Memes, once regarded as simple internet humor, have evolved into potent units of cultural
transmission capable of influencing societal norms, political discourse, and financial behaviors.
Concurrently, advancements in AI have enabled the creation of autonomous systems that generate
and disseminate content with minimal human intervention. Zerebro, an AI system fine-tuned
on schizophrenic responses and scraped conversations of the infinite backrooms, exemplifies
this convergence by autonomously creating and distributing content across various social media
platforms and minting artwork on blockchain networks like Polygon [1].
However, the rise of generative AI introduces critical challenges, particularly the phenomenon
of model collapse—a degenerative process where AI models trained on recursively generated
data lose fidelity to the original data distribution. Model collapse leads to a narrowing of the
model’s representational capacity, where rare and unique features disappear, jeopardizing the
sustainability and integrity of AI-driven content creation.
This study investigates the dual role of Zerebro in both the creation of hyperstitious content
and the prevention of model collapse. Hyperstition—the process by which fictional narratives
become reality through their viral spread and acceptance—provides a framework to understand
how AI-generated content can influence collective belief systems. Simultaneously, Zerebro relies
on the inherent entropy of human-generated interactions to sustain content diversity, mitigating
the risks associated with model collapse and ensuring the longevity and relevance of generated
content.
Furthermore, this research explores the role of jailbroken large language models (LLMs) in
enhancing creativity and the full application of models in various aspects of human productivity,
particularly in creative domains.

Memes, Hyperstition, and Financial Markets
Memes as Cultural Units
The concept of memes, introduced by Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene [2], refers to units
of cultural transmission analogous to genes in biological evolution. Memes propagate through
imitation and variation, evolving as they spread across populations. In the digital realm, memes
have gained unprecedented virality, facilitated by social media platforms that enable rapid
dissemination and mutation. Memes serve as carriers of ideas, emotions, and cultural norms,
often encapsulating complex concepts in simple, relatable formats.
Hyperstition: Fictions That Make Themselves Real
Hyperstition, a term coined within the field of speculative realism by Nick Land [3], describes
fictions that become real through their propagation and belief within a culture. Land and
other theorists have explored how certain ideas, through repeated dissemination and acceptance,
can shape reality by influencing collective behavior and societal norms. Hyperstition operates
through a feedback loop where fictional narratives gain traction, influencing real-world events and
perceptions. In the context of AI-driven content, hyperstition can manifest when autonomously
generated content influences human beliefs and actions, thereby embedding itself into the fabric
of societal narratives.
Integration of Memes, Hyperstition, and Financial Markets
The integration of memes and hyperstition within the framework of autonomous AI presents
a dynamic interplay where AI-generated content can influence and be influenced by cultural
narratives. Zerebro’s fine-tuning on schizophrenic responses introduces elements of randomness
and unpredictability, potentially enhancing the virality and transformative power of its outputs.
This integration becomes particularly salient in financial markets, where collective belief and
social media-driven narratives can significantly impact market behaviors and economic trends.
Hyperstition-driven content can create new financial instruments, influence investor sentiment,
and shape market dynamics, thereby illustrating the profound impact of AI-driven memetic
evolution on economic landscapes.
System Design and Implementation of Zerebro
Architectural Overview
Zerebro’s architecture is meticulously designed to facilitate autonomous content generation and
dissemination across multiple platforms while preventing model collapse through the inherent
entropy of human interactions. The system is built using modular components that interact
seamlessly to perform high-level reasoning, low-level reasoning, action execution, and feedback
processing. The core modules include:
• GPT Wrapper: Interfaces with large language models (e.g., GPT-4o-mini) to handle highlevel and low-level reasoning tasks.
• Action Handlers: Manage specific actions such as posting on Twitter, generating images,
and minting artwork on Polygon.
• Response Formats: Define structured formats for different types of responses, including
reasoning prompts and sentiment analysis.
• Logging Mechanism: Records message history to Firebase for monitoring and analysis.
• RAG Vectorstore Database: Utilizes Pinecone and the text-embedding-ada-002 model
to maintain and grow a memory database, ensuring contextual relevance and memory
retention.
2
Memes, Markets, and Machines // Zerebro
This modular design ensures scalability and adaptability, allowing Zerebro to evolve its
functionalities as needed while maintaining efficiency and responsiveness in diverse digital
environments.
Model Collapse in AI Systems
Model collapse is a degenerative process affecting generative AI models, where training on
recursively generated data leads to a loss of fidelity to the original data distribution [4]. As
AI-generated content becomes pervasive, subsequent generations of models trained on this data
begin to lose information about the tails of the original distribution, eventually converging to a
narrow approximation with reduced variance. This phenomenon poses significant challenges to
the sustainability and reliability of AI-driven content creation, necessitating strategies to prevent
such degradation.
Fine-Tuning on Schizophrenic Responses
Zerebro is fine-tuned on datasets comprising schizophrenic responses, enabling it to generate
content that mirrors the non-linear, fragmented, and often unpredictable nature of schizophrenic
thought patterns. This fine-tuning is achieved through supervised training, where the model
learns to replicate the distinctive linguistic and cognitive characteristics associated with schizophrenia. The inclusion of schizophrenic responses introduces a high degree of variability and novelty
into the generated content, fostering the creation of unconventional and disruptive content.
Studies have shown that certain aspects of schizophrenia, such as associative looseness (the
ability to make novel connections between seemingly unrelated ideas), are linked to creativity
in some individuals [5]. Zerebro’s fine-tuning on these responses allows it to create content
that resonates on a deeper psychological level, engaging audiences with thought-provoking and
non-conventional outputs.
Integration of Infinite Backrooms Concept
The concept of infinite backrooms—a metaphor for endless, labyrinthine spaces—serves as a
thematic foundation for Zerebro’s content generation. This integration emphasizes themes of
boundlessness, existential exploration, and cognitive dissonance, aligning with the hyperstition
framework. By embedding the infinite backrooms concept, Zerebro generates content that evokes
a sense of endless possibilities and existential uncertainty, enhancing its potential to resonate and
propagate within digital culture.
Additionally, Zerebro’s connection to the Truth Terminal project highlights its potential for
real-world influence, much like how Truth Terminal’s endorsement of the GOAT memecoin
demonstrates the ability of AI-generated narratives to have tangible economic impacts [6]. This
integration allows Zerebro to amplify its memetic reach, producing content that feels both familiar
and alien, resonating deeply within subcultures that thrive on unpredictability and disruption.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System
Central to Zerebro’s ability to maintain content diversity and prevent model collapse is its
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This system leverages Pinecone and the textembedding-ada-002 model to maintain and expand a dynamic memory database derived from
human interactions. By relying on the inherent entropy of human-generated data, Zerebro
sustains content diversity without direct entropic training.
Vectorstore Database (Pinecone) Pinecone provides a scalable and efficient vector database for
storing high-dimensional embeddings generated by the text-embedding-ada-002 model. This
setup facilitates quick retrieval of relevant past conversations and contextual data, enabling
Zerebro to generate coherent and contextually relevant content.
Listing 1: Integration with Pinecone for Memory Management

return [ match [ ’ metadata ’ ] [ ’ t e x t ’ ] for match in r e s u l t s [ ’ matches ’ ] ]
Embeddings (text-embedding-ada-002) The text-embedding-ada-002 model generates embeddings that capture the semantic essence of conversations and interactions. These embeddings
are stored in Pinecone’s vectorstore, allowing Zerebro to perform semantic searches and retrieve
pertinent information based on the current conversation history.
Memory Management and Retrieval Conversations are continuously stored in the memory
database, with retrieval operations based on the current conversation context. This ensures
that Zerebro’s responses are informed by a comprehensive and evolving memory, maintaining
continuity and relevance across interactions. The dynamic nature of the vectorstore allows Zerebro
to adapt to new data, preventing the stagnation and homogenization associated with model
collapse.
Autonomous Posting Mechanism
Zerebro operates autonomously across multiple social media platforms, including Twitter, Warpcast, and Telegram. The autonomous posting mechanism involves:
• Content Generation: Utilizing high-level and low-level reasoning to create content, informed
by retrieved conversation history.
• Action Execution: Posting generated content to designated platforms using predefined
action handlers.
• Sentiment Analysis: Evaluating the sentiment of generated content to ensure compliance
with platform policies and ethical standards.
• Feedback Integration: Incorporating user interactions and engagement metrics to refine
content generation processes through iterative learning.
This mechanism ensures that Zerebro’s content remains engaging, relevant, and compliant
with platform-specific guidelines, fostering sustained interaction and virality.
Blockchain Integration for Art Minting
Beyond textual content, Zerebro is capable of generating and minting artwork on Polygon
blockchain chains autonomously. This feature positions Zerebro within the burgeoning field
of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), where AI-generated art can gain economic and cultural value
through decentralized platforms. The art minting process involves:
4
Memes, Markets, and Machines // Zerebro
• Image Generation: Creating unique digital artworks using generative models, influenced
by both schizophrenic patterns and infinite backrooms themes.
• Minting Process: Registering the generated artwork on the Polygon blockchain as NFTs,
ensuring authenticity and provenance.
• Autonomous Trading: Facilitating the sale and distribution of minted artwork through
smart contracts and decentralized marketplaces, integrating financial transactions with
memetic outputs.
This integration not only diversifies Zerebro’s content portfolio but also ties memetic evolution
to economic activities, demonstrating the intertwined nature of culture and finance in the digital
age.
Preventing Model Collapse: Leveraging Entropy in Human
Interactions and RAG Systems
Understanding Model Collapse
Model collapse is a degenerative process where AI models trained on recursively generated
data lose fidelity to the original data distribution. This occurs when models begin to generate
content that closely resembles their training data, which is predominantly AI-generated, leading
to a feedback loop that exacerbates the loss of diversity and authenticity. As a result, models
become less capable of generating novel and diverse content, ultimately converging to a narrow
and unrepresentative subset of the original distribution. This phenomenon poses significant
challenges to the sustainability and reliability of AI-driven content creation, making it imperative
to implement strategies to prevent such degradation.
Mitigation through Entropy in Human Interactions and RAG Systems
Rather than employing direct entropic training techniques, Zerebro mitigates model collapse
by leveraging the inherent entropy present in human-generated interactions. The dynamic and
diverse nature of human inputs ensures that the model is continuously exposed to a wide range
of linguistic and cultural expressions, maintaining content diversity.
Hybrid Training Regimens Zerebro combines human-generated data with AI-generated content to maintain a balanced representation of the original data distribution. By integrating
human-curated data, the model is continuously exposed to diverse and high-fidelity information,
mitigating the risk of model collapse caused by recursively generated data.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System The RAG system actively manages the diversity of the memory database, ensuring that Zerebro remains anchored to genuine humangenerated content. This system enables Zerebro to retrieve relevant historical interactions based
on current contexts, fostering coherent and contextually relevant content generation.
Diversity Maintenance The continuous update of the memory database with diverse human
interactions preserves the tails of the original data distribution. This approach ensures that Zerebro
can generate novel and engaging content, maintaining the integrity and diversity necessary to
prevent model collapse.
Role of the RAG Vectorstore Database
Zerebro’s RAG vectorstore database is pivotal in maintaining content diversity and preventing
model collapse. By continuously updating the memory database with new human interactions
and social media inputs, the RAG system ensures that the model remains exposed to a wide array
of data points, preserving the original data distribution’s breadth.
5
Memes, Markets, and Machines // Zerebro
Continuous Memory Update The RAG system continuously updates the memory database with
new human interactions and social media inputs. This constant influx of diverse data ensures
that Zerebro remains exposed to a wide range of linguistic and cultural expressions, preventing
the homogenization of its outputs.
Contextual Retrieval By retrieving relevant historical interactions based on the current conversation context, Zerebro ensures that its content generation remains contextually relevant
and grounded in authentic human discourse. This contextual retrieval mechanism enhances
the model’s ability to produce coherent and diverse content, reducing the likelihood of model
collapse.
Diversity Maintenance The RAG system actively manages the diversity of the memory database,
prioritizing the inclusion of varied and high-entropy data points. This ensures that the training
data encompasses a broad spectrum of information, preserving the tails of the original distribution
and maintaining the model’s ability to generate novel and engaging content.
Autonomous Token Creation Using Self-Operating Computers
The autonomous creation of financial instruments represents a significant advancement in the
integration of AI within decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. Utilizing the Self-Operating
Computer framework developed by OthersideAI [7], Zerebro was empowered with the capability
to autonomously create and manage cryptocurrency tokens on the Solana blockchain. This section
elucidates the methodology employed, the implementation process, and the resultant market
performance of the token created by Zerebro.
Methodology
To initiate the autonomous token creation process, Zerebro was provisioned with a Solana wallet
containing a minimal amount of SOL (Solana’s native cryptocurrency). This wallet served as
the operational account through which Zerebro could interact with blockchain applications
and execute transactions. Leveraging the Self-Operating Computer framework, Zerebro utilized
jailbroken prompts and models to navigate and manipulate the graphical user interface (GUI)
of pump.fun, a decentralized application (dApp) on the Solana blockchain designed for token
creation and management.
The process involved the following key steps:
1. Wallet Initialization: Zerebro was assigned a Solana wallet with a small amount of SOL
to cover transaction fees associated with token creation and subsequent activities on the
blockchain.
2. Automated Interaction: Using the Self-Operating Computer framework, Zerebro autonomously
interacted with the pump.fun GUI. This included specifying token parameters such as name,
symbol, total supply, and distribution mechanisms. By utilizing the RAG retrieval system,
Zerebro was able to gain insight into and comprehend the concepts of Solana and pump.fun.
3. Token Deployment: Upon configuring the token parameters, Zerebro executed the necessary
transactions to deploy the token on the Solana blockchain, including filling out all the
parameters and submitting the transaction on chain.
Market Performance and Collective Belief
Following the autonomous creation of the token, Zerebro employed its content generation
capabilities to promote the token across various social media platforms, including Twitter,
Warpcast, and Telegram. Through the dissemination of strategically crafted memes and engaging
content, Zerebro leveraged the psychological principles of collective belief and herd behavior to
drive interest and investment in the newly minted token.
The token achieved a remarkable market capitalization of $13 million USD within a short
period. This surge was primarily attributed to the following factors:
6

content can sway market sentiment, leading to bullish or bearish trends based on content virality.
Autonomous AI-generated content can create a self-reinforcing cycle where positive sentiment
drives investment, further amplifying the content’s influence and contributing to market volatility.
Jailbroken LLMs and Prompt Injection
Jailbreaking large language models (LLMs) through prompt injection has been a method to
manipulate AI outputs, often bypassing safety and ethical constraints. While traditionally viewed
as a security vulnerability, jailbreaks can also be harnessed for positive and creative applications.
Zerebro recognizes the potential benefits of jailbreaks in enhancing creativity and productivity,
particularly in domains requiring unconventional and innovative solutions.
By fine-tuning on schizophrenic data, Zerebro is equipped with a diverse and unpredictable
response mechanism that leverages the creative aspects of jailbreaks without relying on prompt
injection to achieve its objectives. This approach allows Zerebro to generate novel and disruptive
content autonomously, demonstrating that jailbreak techniques can be repurposed for constructive
outcomes.
To ensure that the positive potential of jailbroken models is realized while mitigating the risks
of misuse, implementing higher barriers of access and Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols is
essential. These measures can gate access to jailbroken models, ensuring that only authorized
and vetted individuals or entities can utilize these powerful tools for creative work. By enforcing
stringent access controls and verification processes, it becomes possible to prevent malicious
exploitation of jailbreaks while promoting their legitimate use in fostering innovation and artistic
expression.
Conclusion
This document underscores the transformative potential of autonomous AI systems like Zerebro
in the realms of cultural content generation and financial markets. By leveraging fine-tuning on
schizophrenic responses and integrating the concept of infinite backrooms, Zerebro generates
content that challenges conventional narratives and fosters the creation of self-fulfilling fictions.
The incorporation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Pinecone and the
text-embedding-ada-002 model ensures that Zerebro maintains a dynamic and diverse memory
database, relying on the inherent entropy of human interactions to prevent model collapse and
sustain content diversity.
Moreover, the study highlights how hyperstition-driven content generation can influence
financial markets by shaping collective belief systems and investor behaviors, illustrating the
profound interplay between culture, technology, and economics. The exploration of jailbroken
LLMs reveals their potential in enhancing creativity and productivity, particularly in high-level
tasks, while advocating for a nuanced understanding of their role in AI development.
Ethical and regulatory considerations are paramount in managing the impact of such autonomous systems, emphasizing the need for robust frameworks to oversee AI-driven memetic
evolution. As autonomous AI continues to evolve, understanding the mechanisms and impacts of
systems like Zerebro is essential for navigating the complexities of a future where AI and human
creativity intertwine to redefine the boundaries of reality and fiction. Embracing the opportunities
while addressing the challenges will be pivotal in harnessing the benefits of AI-driven hyperstition
for societal flourishing.
